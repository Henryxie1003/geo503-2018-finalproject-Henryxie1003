# Introduction
Phenology has been proven as a sensitive and integrative indicator of climate variability and vegetation growth responses to climate change (X. Zhao, K. Tan, 2011). The understanding of phenology brings significant insight into both climate and vegetation interactions and their impacts on different spatial and temporal scales (Y. He, 2013). NDVI and EVI are two most widely used indexes in vegetation phenology study.This project aims at tracking phenology change of forest at Nature View Park in Buffalo in the past decade. 

# Materials and methods
The traditional way of monitoring forest phenology uses remote sensing data such as Landsat TM or MODIS data which is efficient in large-scale studies. 

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(RCurl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```


We are going to use the `occ()` function to download _occurrence_ records for the American robin (_Turdus migratorius_) from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](gbif.org).

```{r, warning=F} 
## define which species to query
sp='Turdus migratorius'

## run the query and convert to data.frame()
d = occ(query=sp, from='ebird',limit = 100) %>% occ2df()
```
This can take a few seconds.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map illustrating the known occurrence locations"}
# Load coastline
map=map_data("world")

ggplot(d,aes(x=longitude,y=latitude))+
  geom_polygon(aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),data=map)+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  coord_equal()
```


# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r}
hist(d$latitude)
```

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
